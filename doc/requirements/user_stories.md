# Day Reservations User Stories

1. As a user I want the home page to initially open displaying the day schedule for all assets for today's date so that
I can see the allocated time for each asset for today.

2. As a user, from the home page,  I want to select a new date and the page will display the day schedule for all assets for the new date so that I can see the allocated time for each asset for the selected day.

3. As a user, I want to reserve one or more time ranges for a particular asset for the displayed day so that it is clear to myself and other users that I have the time reserved.

4. As the system administrator, I want to be able to modify the current list of managed assets so that the application will 
have the flexibility to continue working as the assets under management change.
