These are captured as "issues" on GitHub and named Story 1, Story 2, etc

I can see the allocated time for each asset for today.

2. As a user, from the home page,  I want to select a new date and the page will display the day schedule for all assets for the new date so that I can see the allocated time for each asset for the selected day.

3. As a user, I want to reserve one or more time ranges for a particular asset for the displayed day so that it is clear to myself and other users that I have the time reserved.
